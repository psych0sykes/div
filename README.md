# divdiv

Welcome to divdiv, a living social art project.


# make *your* div

Make an account, pick your color. Log in later, change your color. Watch the divdiv page fill with divs. Each one representing another digital neighbor.

## the significance of connections
Technology thrives on connections, and so do you. You connect with friends, family, news, sports, memes, music and so much more. Common ground, interests and concerns are some of the strings that form these connections. Emotions like joy and fear, love and hate can also form connections. If you could paint a picture of every person and the connections between them, what would it look like? **divdiv** is how I imagine it would look. An ocean of boxes, crammed together into an endless page. Thousands of colors, millions of patterns. While every person may have their own color of div and their own personality, the size and shape are still the same. And everyone is connected to someone else.

## a living art piece
**divdiv** is meant to change. Each time you look at it, it's meant to be different. In the applications youngest stage, users have the freedom to pick their div color, and change it whenever they want. A future development goal is to link user div color changes to user actions elsewhere online. API's to catch when a user tweets, or follows someone new. When they make a new friend on Facebook, or maybe when they start listening to music on Spotify. Having a flat mass of colored squares is fine. Having a dynamic mass of colored squares that are constantly changing based on actual human activity is fine + 1.
